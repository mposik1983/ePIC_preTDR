1. Study to see the impact of the MPGD-BOT on angular resolutuions.
2. epic: contains codes that were modified in the epic repo to incudle a hit sensitive DIRC reference layer
3. EICrecon: code modified to perform the track reconstruction and propagation to DIRC
4. 
6. MPGD_AngularResolution_Impact.ipynb: plots angular resolution results
